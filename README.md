### Original Brief

> Build a simple **web** *or* **command line** **app**lication, which should 
> allow users to enter an arbitrary GitHub username, and be presented with a 
> best guess of the GitHub user's favourite programming language.

> This can be computed by using the GitHub API to fetch all of the user's 
> public GitHub repos, each of which includes the name of the dominant 
> language for the repository.

> Documentation for the GitHub API can be found at http://developer.github.com.




### Background & Research

- Out of the list I chose Ajax.org's **node-github**
